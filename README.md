  cd soundify
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Download Special Builds**

   This project uses native code, so a special build is required for each platform:

   - **Android**: [Link to Android build download](https://expo.dev/accounts/darkincorporation/projects/soundify/builds/90f2a93c-1306-4566-8ffa-74b9a9e96664)

4. **Configure Clerk for Authentication**

   For proper authentication functionality, a Clerk API Key must be configured:

   - Create a project in Clerk at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com).
   - Copy the project’s Publishable Key.
   - Create a .env file in the project root and add the key:

  ```bash
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-clerk-key-here"
  ```

5. **Start the Expo Server**

   Start the Expo server so the app can runs:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

6. **Run on Simulator**

   With the build downloaded and installed, run the app on your preferred simulator. Access the localhost address generated by Expo CLI in the simulator to connect it to the server.
